# Four Corners Farmhands
The humble beginnings of a Stardew Valley Mod <3  
## Summary
You've left your city life behind to become a farmer in the valley. But that doesn't mean you have to do it alone! After reaching out to your friends, and their friends, and THEIR friends, you've managed to get the help of 12 new farmhands.  
By your request, Robin has built empty plots around your farm. Your farmhands have each claimed one. All that's left is to build them some cabins to stay in, and you'll be all set to start your new life in Stardew Valley!  
## Changes
### Cabins
The Four Corners Farm map had been edited to include 12 empty plots. Each can be upgraded using various resources into custom cabins. Once a farmhand's cabin is built, they'll move in the next day.  
### Professions
Each farmhand has a unique job and will grant unique perks as they set to work. There will be a letter at each plot written by the farmhand who will live there. This letter will give you an idea of what their job as your farmhand will be. A more specific list of professions will be listed under the Spoilers section.  
### Friendship
While you will not have to give your farmhands anything to recieve their starter perks, you can unlock bonus perks if you take the time to grow your friendship with them. A list of all farmhand perks will be listed under the Spoilers section.  
  
  
## Spoilers
**If you want to experience this mod blindly, stop reading.** The following section will have more details about each farmhand so more experienced players can know exactly what to expect, if desired.  

If you did not stop reading, I have bad news-- the details of this mod aren't quite finalized yet, so the details will be imcomplete for the time being.  
**Miner**  
Starter Perk: Keeps your farm clear of rocks, mines the personal quarry, and gives you the materials for it.  
Bonus Perk: Will clear out the quarry for you, or go adventuring in the mines for the day as long as the Fighter is present on the farm.  
**Fighter**  
Starter Perk: Will protect the farm from monsters if monster spawning is on. May follow you to the mines for the day (?), or provide combat items(?) will give you all loot dropped from monsters killed.  
Bonus Perk: Will go adventuring in the mines for the day as long as the Miner is present on the farm.  
**Logger**  
Starter Perk: Keeps your farm clear from trees, seeds, sticks, and stumps from chopped trees. Will give you all drops from this activity.  
Bonus Perk: Can be sent to the forest for the day to bring back wood and any foragables. This activity will not actually clear anything from the forest, except foragables(?)  
**Tiller**  
Starter Perk: Will keep every space in a selected area tiled if it is empty. May also sew seeds? Keeps the greenhouse tilled.  
Bonus Perk: Can be sent out for the day to go forage farming (winter) or clay farming (all other seasons). Will bring back the contents of any artifact spots(?)  
**Haymaker**  
Starter Perk: Will keep the farm clear of fiber and/or grass, depending on your preference. If an empty silo is present, grass will always yield hay at golden scythe rates.  
Bonus Perk: Will feed and pet all animals, and collect any goods for the day. Animals will no longer consume grass.  
**Katherine -- Chef**  
Starter Perk: Produces dishes of your choosing daily. If other farmhands are present (planter, fisher) then the dishes will be higher quality due to fresh ingredients.  
Bonus Perk: When given an artisan good, will produce more in shorter periods of time. Regular quality?. (Or other?)  
**Fisher**  
Starter Perk: Produces fish and fish bait. Can buy or order fishing tools.  
Bonus Perk: Can be sent out to focus on catching a specific fish, including legendaries.  
**Social Butterfly**  
Starter Perk: Provides tips of what villagers like and dislike, reminds you of birthdays, and provides loved gifts for holidays.  
Bonus Perk: Can be sent out to socialize with a specific person to fill out(completely?) your social page about them. When a personâ€™s info is complete, there will be an indicator.  
**Merchant**  
Starter Perk: Will sell rare and valuable items.  
Bonus Perk: Can be sent out to barter for a specific item of any quality, bringing it back for free.  
**Machinist**  
Starter Perk: Will automatically process raw ingredients given, and harvest any finished machines (including statues, such as the Statue of Perfection.)  
Bonus Perk: Will speed up the aging of items in casks by 50%.  
**Irrigator**  
Starter Perk: Will keep any tilled soil on the farm (and greenhouse) watered. If the amount of unwatered tiles is less than a certain amount, the player will be notified. If the planter is present, this service can be swapped out with plant care. Plant care increases the likelihood of double harvest, high quality crops, and early growth.  
Bonus Perk: Can be asked to automatically apply fertilizer, speed-gro, or retaining soil to the plants they water, or any sprinklers with enrichers on the farm. (or not requiring enrichers?)   
**Planter**  
Starter Perk: Will automatically plant the selected seeds in the selected area wherever the ground is tilled. If the tiller is present, the selection menu will show all the spaces that WILL be tilled as tilled. Can also automatically harvest fruit trees.  
Bonus Perk: Sets up a crow-prevention system. No crows will eat your crops while this is active, even without scarecrows.
